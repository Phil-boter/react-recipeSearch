# react-recipeSearch

This app will help you, when you are in the supermarket still not knowing what to eat or cook,
by searching online for shopping lists and recipes.
If everything fails it also has an implemented restaurant search for the nearest local of your choice.

## About
    This project is a further development of my final project 
    I builded during my attendance to the Coding Bootcamp at Spiced Academy's in Berlin.

    At the homepage the user can decide to search for shoppinglists or restaurants.
    It is also possible to make an user account. 
    Setting up an user the account offers the possibility
    to save shopping list and restaurants in a favourites list.
    It is also possible to store and delete favourite lists. 
    Finally the user can decide to logout or to delete the account.
    Two different server side API calls are made for the search functionality.
    Now the app is managed by redux and uses hooks instead of class-components.
    
    The app is optimized for mobile use.
